This project contains functions for computing with up-down signatures.

Up-down signatures are described in:

-   Fink, Willbrand, Brown. *1-D random landscapes and non-random data series*,
    EPL **79**, 2007

The algorithms in this library are a generalization of those described above in
that they can handle the case where each bin of the categorical variable can
hold more than one value.

This library is used by the command line tool
[sigscore](https://github.com/b4winckler/sigscore).
